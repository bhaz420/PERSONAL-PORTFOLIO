*Polymorphism- A fundamental concept In Object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects from different classes To be treated AS objects Of a common base Class.

*It enables you To Write code that can work With different types Of objects In a uniform way.
*There are two main types Of polymorphism In OOP: compile-time (Or Static) polymorphism And runtime (Or Dynamic) polymorphism.

*It Is typically achieved through method overloading And Operator overloading.

*Method overloading: You can define multiple methods In the same Class With the same Name but different parameter lists. 
The appropriate method To call Is determined by the method signature at compile time based On the arguments passed.

*The Assignment outlined different principles within creating a console application such As:

1.Create an interface called IQuittable and have it define a void method called Quit().

2.Have your Employee class from the previous drill inherit that interface and implement the Quit() method in any way you choose.

3.Use polymorphism to create an object of type IQuittable and call the Quit() method on it. Hint: an object can be of an interface type if it implements that specific interface.

4.Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.
