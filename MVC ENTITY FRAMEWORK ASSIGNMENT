During this assignment we built an application for a car insurance quote which involved many different variations relating to driving records, tickets and violations. 
We then created a database to store this information for administration purposes:
Here is an outline of the code logics we acounted for:

1.Start with a base of $50 / month.

2.If the user is 18 or under, add $100 to the monthly total.

3.If the user is from 19 to 25, add $50 to the monthly total.

4.If the user is 26 or older, add $25 to the monthly total. Double check your code to ensure all ages are covered.

5.If the car's year is before 2000, add $25 to the monthly total.

6.If the car's year is after 2015, add $25 to the monthly total.

7.If the car's Make is a Porsche, add $25 to the price.

8.If the car's Make is a Porsche and its model is a 911 Carrera, add an additional $25 to the price. (Meaning, this specific car will add a total of $50 to the price.)

9.Add $10 to the monthly total for every speeding ticket the user has.

10.If the user has ever had a DUI, add 25% to the total.

11.If it's full coverage, add 50% to the total.

12.Modify the Create View so that the user does not see the “Quote” input field.
Add an Admin View for a site administrator to the Insuree Views. This page must show all quotes issued, along with the user's first name, last name, and email address.
